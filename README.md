## 🌟 About Me

I’m a recent Cybersecurity graduate who has applied classroom knowledge through hands-on labs in network defense, vulnerability assessment, and security auditing. 

My background in IT operations and workforce analytics enables me turn technical insights into business success. 

Recent projects include mapping NIST 800-53 controls for an e-commerce mock-up and strengthening Windows networks against MS17-010. 

My GitHub will showcase the skills I’m developing and the challenges I plan to tackle next.
