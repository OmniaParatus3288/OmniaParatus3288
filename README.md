## 🌟 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in IT operations and a growing specialty in threat detection, compliance, and adversary simulation. I’ve transitioned from workforce analytics into the cyber world with hands-on experience through academic labs, personal Home Lab projects, and participation in WiCyS and Google’s Cybersecurity Certificate Program (now completed ✅).

I’m currently completing my B.S. in Cybersecurity and diving deep into frameworks like NIST 800-53 and MITRE ATT&CK. My GitHub is where I build, break, fix, and document; showcasing not only the skills I have but the ones I’m actively mastering.

🧪 Currently working on:  
- **Hack The Box Job Role Paths**: Junior Cyber Security Analyst & Penetration Tester  
- **CompTIA Security+** (studying in progress)


✅ **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** *(completed!)*  7/27/25
