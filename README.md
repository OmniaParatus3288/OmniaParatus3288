## 🌟 About Me

I’m a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a strong focus on penetration testing, digital forensics, incident response (DFIR), and cybersecurity awareness.  

I come from a diverse professional background in IT operations, workforce management, and technical support, which helps me connect technical skills with real-world business impact.  

While studying at Full Sail University, I’ve worked on projects covering network security, compliance frameworks like NIST 800-53, vulnerability assessments, and security auditing. I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to deepen my hands-on skills!

This page is a reflection of my journey, showcasing the projects and experiences shaping my path in cybersecurity.
